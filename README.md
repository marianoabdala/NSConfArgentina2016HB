# NSConfArgentina2016HB
Mariano Abdala's heartbeat tracking from the day of the NSConf Argentina 2016

In the hopes that someone might find this useful.

In heart-beats.xml you'll find an export from the Healt app of iOS 9.

That file contains:
* My heartbeat (of course)
* Date of birth
* Gender
* Height
* Weight

I went on stage at about `2016-04-16 09:36:00 -0300` where you can see a spike from `73` to a incredibily anxious `131`.
